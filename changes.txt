Player.py

-- Methods:

player.py

   - Add play method

   - Add replace_card method, remove the stacks parameter and return the new stack
    (method replaces take_stack)

   - Add sum_stacks method, which returns a list of the sum of all stacks

   - Add get_index_of_closest_stack method which returns the index of the stack that
     is closest to the discarded card in value

   - Add add_card method which adds a card on top of the stack and returns the new
     stack

   - Add pick_smallest_stack which returns the stacks with the least number of
     bull points

   - play method in Player returns a tuple of the new stack and the player's
     bull points


dealer.py

   - simulate_game in dealer now requires the number of turns, and has an optional
     argument to specify the number of rounds

   - simulate_round requires the number of turns

   - create_stacks now returns the stack

   - Dealer now hands players the cards, and players update their cards,
     so the Dealer no longer mutates the fields directly

-- Data structures:
    -- Dealer no longer tracks stacks, rounds or turns because they're not needed
    -- Player no longer tracks his own bull points. Instead, a corresponding list
       bull points is tracked by the Dealer


-- Test files:
  - all tests changed because most of them no longer use muation
  - and due to changes in data structures documented above
